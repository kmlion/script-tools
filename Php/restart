Using SysV Init scripts directly:
/etc/init.d/php-fpm restart    # typical
/etc/init.d/php5-fpm restart   # debian-style
/etc/init.d/php7.0-fpm restart # debian-style PHP 7

Using service wrapper script
service php-fpm restart    # typical
service php5-fpm restart   # debian-style
service php7.0-fpm restart # debian-style PHP 7

Using Upstart (e.g. ubuntu):
restart php7.0-fpm         # typical (ubuntu is debian-based) PHP 7
restart php5-fpm           # typical (ubuntu is debian-based)
restart php-fpm            # uncommon

Using systemd (newer servers):
systemctl restart php-fpm.service    # typical
systemctl restart php5-fpm.service   # uncommon
systemctl restart php7.0-fpm.service # uncommon PHP 7
